// By default, the spawn function does not create a shell to execute the command we pass into it. 
// This makes it slightly more efficient than the exec function, which does create a shell.
// The exec function has one other major difference.
// It buffers the commandâ€™s generated output and passes the whole output value to a callback function (instead of using streams, 
// which is what spawn does).
